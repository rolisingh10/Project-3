# Pollution Isn't Minnesota Nice: EPA FRS-Monitored Sites vs. Health Outcomes, Asthma Rates, and Cancer Rates by County

# Kendal Bergman, Joanna DeLaune, Greg Michalak, Aaron Otto, Roli Singh

This project is a full-stack web application that examines the relationship between the presence and concentration of EPA Facility Registry Service (FRS) -monitored sites in Minnesota and health outcomes in each county, as well as asthma and cancer rates by county.

**Data Sourcing and Cleaning**

We located and evaluated appropriate datasets and cleaned the data for ingestion into the database layer. We wanted to study the effects of environmental pollution on the health of residents. We wanted to study these effects locally, so we chose Minnesota and we further divided the state into counties. After narrowing down, we concluded to include asthma and cancer as the ailments. We also included the healthoutcome and healthfactors of each county which are calculated by County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R), University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. The datasets of the healthoutcome and healthfactors included Z-scores which is a right measure to compare.

We extracted four datasets for our study. These are as following:

    Asthma hospitalization rates for 2018-2020 by county
    Cancer rates by county 2015-2019
    Health Outcomes and Factors Rankings 2023
    The steps taken in data cleaning:
    We extracted the csv files of asthma data and cancer rate data and transformed them into dataframes using pandas(python). The same was done to excel file of healthoutcomes.
    We looked at all the columns in the dataframe. We looked for null values, dropped the columns and renamed columns.
    We jsonified the data to be saved in MongoDB.

**MongoDB**

We wrote Python code (see Jupyter notebook file 'Make_DB_file_v1a.ipynb') to create a MongoDB database and populate it with our data.  The PyMongo scripts will load all data sets located in Project_3_Data file.  The PyMongo was writen to be able to add multiple new features and files by adding a file path and var name for each new file needing loading.  The notebook will print out meta examples of each file and their corresponding structures for purposes of the API developer and others understanding. 

Step 1: Imports libraries and creates the mongodb client as well as database is named.  
Step 2: Loads all the corresponding files through a for loop. This is the step where we can add any feature or other file in with one line of code.  
Step 3: Prints out feature collections and one document meta
Step 4: Merges the the feature files into one Json for API cosumption. Prints out a success measure and top one record to show structure of final merged features file.  

**Flask API**

We created a Flask API (see 'pimn_api.py') to get both datasets from the MongoDB database and expose them to be acquired via web browser.

Since the EPA FRS sites have longitude and latitude specified, we wrote a function to transform this dataset to geoJSON format for added functionality in the next step.

Note: In this particular instance, our database is static and it is not expected that it will be updated regularly. It would therefore have been more efficient to write the code to fetch the data once rather than each time the API is called. However, in most cases an API would be serving data in real time, and so we elected to write code that would function as desired in the more commonly encountered situation.
